### Running Performance Analysis
```sql
-- Enable profiling for query analysis
SET profiling = 1;

-- Execute your query
SELECT b.*, u.first_name, p.name 
FROM Booking b 
JOIN User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id 
JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id 
WHERE b.start_date >= '2024-01-01';

SHOW PROFILES;
EXPLAIN ANALYZE [your_query];
```

### Monitoring Database Performance
```sql
-- Check current slow queries
SELECT 
    ROUND(AVG_TIMER_WAIT/1000000000, 3) AS avg_seconds,
    COUNT_STAR as executions,
    LEFT(DIGEST_TEXT, 100) AS query_sample
